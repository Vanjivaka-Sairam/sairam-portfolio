      <p className="text-gray-300">I'm Vanjivaka Sairam, a third-year B.Tech student in Mathematics and Computing at the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar. I’m passionate about full-stack development, algorithms, and cryptography. I’ve built a range of impactful projects—from an e-commerce site with an admin dashboard using the MERN stack to a secure digital image encryption system combining AES and RSA. My tech toolkit includes C, C++, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS, and more.

I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and am especially interested in building efficient, user-centric applications. Beyond tech, I'm actively involved in sports and have represented IIT Ropar in many volleyball tournaments.

Always eager to learn and collaborate, I’m looking forward to opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully and grow both technically and personally.</p>
